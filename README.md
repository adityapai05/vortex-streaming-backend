# **Vortex Video Streaming App - Backend**

Welcome to the **Vortex Video Streaming App Backend**! This repository contains the backend services powering the Vortex application, a video streaming platform. The backend is built with a focus on learning and implementing modern backend development practices.  

This project is currently **under development** and serves as a learning exercise for building robust APIs, handling user authentication, and managing video streaming-related functionalities.

---

## **Features**

- **User Authentication**:  
  Secure user registration and login using hashed passwords and JWT-based authentication.

- **Role Management**:  
  Separate roles for Admin and User with role-based access control (RBAC).

- **Video Management**:  
  APIs for uploading, updating, and managing video metadata (title, description, etc.).

- **Video Streaming**:  
  Serve videos using optimized chunk-based streaming (to be implemented).

- **Middleware Integration**:  
  - CORS: Configurable for secure cross-origin requests.  
  - Cookie Parsing: For managing session-related tokens.  
  - Error Handling: Standardized error handling with custom error and response classes.

- **Async Wrappers**:  
  Industry-standard async handlers for streamlined request management.

---

## **Tech Stack**

- **Language**: JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (using Mongoose ODM)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with refresh tokens
- **Middleware**: CORS, Cookie Parser, Express JSON/URL Encoders

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)  
- MongoDB (running instance or MongoDB Atlas)  

### **Installation**

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vortex-streaming-backend.git
   cd vortex-streaming-backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:  
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following variables:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/vortex
   ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=<your_access_token_secret>
   REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=<your_refresh_token_secret>
   CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Test the API endpoints using tools like Postman or cURL.
